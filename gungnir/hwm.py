"""High-water-mark (last-successful-upload) tracking.

Writes a small JSON file to the per-tool config dir after each successful
upload so external monitoring (e.g. a lab-doctor scanner) can read it and
tell at a glance how stale the feeder is.

File layout::

    {
        "last_upload_iso": "2026-05-28T12:34:56Z",
        "last_upload_ts": 1716902096.0,
        "counters": {           # every counter the server returned
            "aircraft_imported": 4,
            "aircraft_already_seen": 6,
            ...
        },
        "last_upload_payload": {...}  # full server response for debugging
    }

The ``counters`` field is the agreed source of truth. Consumers should
read from it rather than parsing ``last_upload_payload``. We intentionally
do NOT extract one number to a top-level field; "imported" means different
things to different slots (aircraft vs networks vs meshcore) and exposing
a single scalar mis-states reality for the slots that aren't aircraft.

Ported from wigle-to-wdgwars v1.0 with the single-scalar mistake corrected.
