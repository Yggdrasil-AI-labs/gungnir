"""Failure-mode detectors for wdgwars.pl uploads.

The big one: **silent drop**. The server can return `HTTP 200 ok:true` while
having rejected every record server-side. This shows up as zero across all
known counters on a non-empty chunk. Shipped originally in Muninn v1.11.1
after locosp's v4 server patch tightened type validation and silently
dropped every aircraft with an unrecognized emitter category.

Lesson learned the hard way: any future tool that POSTs to wdgwars.pl
without checking this is *guaranteed* to ship a silent regression eventually,
because server-side validation is opaque and changes without notice.
