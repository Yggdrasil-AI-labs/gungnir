"""Server-cooldown persistence.

When wdgwars.pl returns a 429 (rate limit) with a `retry_after` field, the
caller should not just sleep. It should persist the deadline so the next
cron invocation also respects it. Otherwise a per-minute cron will hammer
the server while a previous upload is still being queued/processed.

Ported from wigle-to-wdgwars v1.0. State lives in the per-tool config dir
under `cooldown.json` to keep it next to the API key.
