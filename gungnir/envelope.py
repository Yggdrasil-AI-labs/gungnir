"""HMAC-SHA256 envelope for the wdgwars.pl signed-JSON endpoint.

Envelope shape (canonical, as accepted by https://wdgwars.pl/api/upload/):

        "data":  base64(json(payload)),
        "nonce": hex(8 random bytes),         # 16 hex chars
        "sig":   hex(hmac_sha256(key, nonce + data_b64))
    }

The payload is whatever combination of `networks`, `aircraft`, and
`meshcore_nodes` keys the caller provides, slots not supplied default to
empty lists. The server tolerates any combination; tools fill only the
slot relevant to their input.

Extracted from muninn.py v1.11.1 upload() (lines 1267-1283). Byte-identical
output for the same (payload, key, nonce) tuple, preserved deliberately so
tests can compare gungnir output against the muninn-1.x golden vectors.
